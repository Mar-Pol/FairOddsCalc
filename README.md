# FairOddsCalc – Legacy Version

This repository contains the **original standalone version** of FairOddsCalc.

Over time, FairOddsCalc has evolved and is now being integrated into a larger project.  
As part of this transition, old repositories have been removed or archived, and this one is kept solely as a reference to the original implementation.


> ⚠️ This version is no longer maintained and the hosted site will be discontinued.  
> A new, improved version will be part of the upcoming unified project. Stay tuned.
